Logic building fundamentals
--------------------------------

1. understand the problem
	clearly define what is the problem asking
	break down the problem into smaller and manageable parts.

2. Start solving with simple steps:
	input: what do you need to start with (input form User)

	processing: what steps/ what operations you want to perform?
		    to achieve the desired output

	output: what result or solution is required at last?

3. Start writing algorithm
4. start creating flowcharts and pseudocode

	flowchart: visualize the steps using very simple diagram

	pseudocode: write the steps in plain language before translating them into actual code.
			(it may differ from user to user)
5. Basic Constructs:

	sequential execution: instructions which are executed one after another

	conditional statements:
		use if, if else, else if ladder, switch case, nested if to make some decisions.
		if a number is greater than 10 print large else print small.

	iterative statements: (loop)
		repetitive action to repeat some certain task multiple time
		for, while, do while 

Let's try to build the logic by solving some problems

1. Write a program which check the given number is even or odd.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. get a number from user
	2. check if the number is divisible by 2.
	3. if true, print 'EVEN', other wise print 'ODD'

2. Sum of Digits of a number
-------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. get a number from user
	2. initialize variable sum to 0
	3. extract each digit using modulus operator (%)
	4. add each extracted digit to sum
	5. divide the given number by 10
	6. repeat step 3 to 5 until num>0
	7. print sum.


3. Write a logic to calculate area of square.
4. Write a logic to calculate area of circle.
5. Write a logic to check users age is valid or not (age>=18 then valid)
6. Write a logic to reverse a string.

	'sonam' then the output should be 'manos'
