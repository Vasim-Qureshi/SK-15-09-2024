Modules:
--------------------
node js provides diffrent types of packages/Modules

Using that we can directly implement our project.

3 types of Modules:

    1. Core Modules:
        which is already coming when you install node js
        default Modules
        --  we can use it without installing them

    2. Local Modules:
        User Defined Modules
        we can create them, we can use them
        we can also publish them on NPM registery

    3. Third Party Modules
        external or third party Modules
        if you want to use them then your have to install them

********** Core Modules **************
You can see the list of core modules on node js documentation page.
common modules are 
    OS
    Path
    URL
    FS (file system)
    HTTP (for creating server)

-- while working any js code by default the module for your project is commonjs
which ES5
inside this if you want to use some module you have to use it using require
const url = require('url')

if you want to update it to ES6 module feature create package.json: npm init -y

open package.json file
add one property: type: 'module'

then import module using import key word only
import path from 'path';
