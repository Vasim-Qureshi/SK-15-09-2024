WebSockets is a comminication protocol which is providing full duplex 
communication channels over a single TCP connection.

WebSockets are used to build real time application like chat apps,
live notification and games.

HTTP is using request and response based approach, whereas WebSockets allows
both client and servers send and receive data any time, without 
having to request first.

we will use ws library (package) to implement WebSockets
