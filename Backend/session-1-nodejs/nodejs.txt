What is NodeJS?

Its a runtime environment. Its platform using that we can run Javascript whitout
embedding it In HTML.

Simply we can say that earlier JS we have executed inside the browser.
That's why its called client side Scripting. (frontend)

Now, we can run JS directly without taking help of any browser.
So JS is also used as Server Side scripting. (backend)

How to work with that?

step 1: install Node JS
https://nodejs.org/en/download (download windows .msi installer)

just follow the simple installation steps b doing next next and finish.
No need to change anything. Just keep default configuration.

Now, let's verify the installation.
open terminal (cmd)
> node -v (give node version)
> npm -v (gives npm version)

NPM is node package manager with comes with nodejs only no need to intall 
manually

********* Why NodeJS? **********

Node JS is javascript runtime build on Chrome V8 Engine. It allows you to run
JS code outside the browser as well. Mailny called server side.

1. Javascript everywhere
    Its verstile language using that we can do frontend as well backend.
    It has simplified the implementation.
    Easy to share the code between client and server.

2. Non-Blocking, Asynchronous I/O
    uses event-driver and non-blocking architecture.
    Handling multiple request at same time without any waiting.
    good for perfomance.

3. Fast Execution:
    running of Google's V8 engine.
4. NPM EcoSystem
    Huge library of multiple tools and packages.
5. Community Support
6. Cross platform
7. Real Time Capabilities

We can use Node JS for
----------------------------------
    Rest APIs
    Microservices
    Real Time Application (chat, notifications)
    Streaming Services
    IoT Applications

Copnanies using Node JS
--------------------------------
    Netflix
    LinkedIn
    Paypal
    Uber
    Walmart

How to open it: in your terminal write node and then enter

to exit do ctrl+c 2 times

NPM ?

Node package manager
------------------------
we can install, update, share and manage the reusable code 
-- reusable code means packages or library or modules

Key Features of NPM:

1. package installation:
2. create configuration file (package.json)
3. Global and Local installation
4. Create Scripts
5. NPM registery
6. Semantic Versioning (semver)
   NPM uses version control with
   ^ minor update 
   ~ patch update

Let's create Package.json.
> npm init -y

Let's Do some Local installation
> npm install mysql (npm i mysql)

when you install it will update your package.json file in dependencies
also, it will create package-lock.json file where it is including exact location
from where the dependencies downloaded.

Also, where it is exactly downloaded 
inside node_modules folder.

When you share your code to someone just share it without node modules folder.
why? 
when they want to download it they can just execute one command.
> npm install

How to see installed dependencies:

> npm list

to uninstall
> npm uninstall mysql

Also, if we want to install more than 1 dependencies together how?

> npm i express mongodb nodemon

To uninstall

> npm uninstall express mongodb nodemon

in old node js for local installation we are using --save
 npm i express --save (install in local)

with latest npm i express that means it will install dependencies locally.

few dependencies we required only for testing purpose when we are 
doing development but its not required in production.

those dependencies you can install in development dependencies
how?

npm i nodemon --save-dev  (only for development)
npm i express (used in development + production)

When you push it on Github must add .gitignore file to ignore node_modules
folder.

Let's talk about Global installation
----------------------------------------

global packages are getting installed inside your C: drive node_modules 
folder which we can use in all directories.

--when you install any package locally you can't run its command directly 
from terminal because its installed locally.

How to install globally
------------------------------
npm i typescript -g 
npm i json-server -g 

check it:: npm list -g
verify local installation: npm list 

if packages installed globally your can check version directly from terminal
> json-server --version
> tsc -v 

uninstall Global packages

> npm uninstall typescript -g
> npm uninstall json-server -g

But what if i have installed package locally and still i want to run command 
from terminal..

for that we can use script.

open scrit in package.json file write your script and that you can run using
npm run command

npm run script-name

For updating any package you can run
> npm update

Which packages we can install locally and which we can install globally

let's say I am working with angular project version 12 or 15
those dependencies required to be installed globally.

When I am working with backend projects
in folder we need to install dependencies locally
because if you use global installation, let's say my project is created with express some x version

I upgraded my dependencies to y 
now if I am trying run my project will it work?

So it is always suggested to install project dependencies locally.

If you are creating package.json file by just using npm init then it will prmpt with
some questions you can give values as per your requirements.
If you don't want to give any value then just press enter so it will take default value.

Last it will show you the cretaed file you can confirm the same using yes then it will create 
package.json file.
