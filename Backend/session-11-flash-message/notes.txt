Flash messages basically used to display one-time notification to the users
--> success or error messages after that redirect users

If you are using some middleware which is session middleware for that we 
can use.

We can implement same using express, express-session and connect-flash

ejs is template engine which is used to provide static pages directly
from express

Here I am using template engine so let's understand it.

create package.json file using npm init -y
instal dependencies:
    npm i express express-session connect-flash ejs nodemon
also edit  type:module and start script in package.json

create app.js 
create views folder:
    create index.ejs
    cretae user.ejs

start server using npm start, check output
