Introduction to Trees
-----------------------------------

A Tree is a herarchical data structure which consists of nodes 
which connected by edges.

It actually creates real world tree but upside down, starting from root.

Node: an element of Tree

Root: top-most Node

Parent: a Node which has branches (children)

Child: A node derived from a Parent

Leaf: A node with no children

sub-tree: A tree inside another tree

depth: length of  the path from root to the node

height: length of the logest path from a root node to a Leaf

-------------------Types Of Trees-----------------

Binary Tree: Each Node has at most 2 children

Binary Search Tree (BST): left child < right child

N-ary Tree: Each node can have at most N children
