Longest Common SubSequence (LCS)
 Given 2 strings s1 and s2
 find the length of the longest sub sequence present in both

 s1 = "abcde"
 s2 = "ace"

 length = 3 (ace)

 -----------------------
 s1 = "abc"
 s2 = "def"

 length = 0

 //solve using plain recursion as well as optimized one
