Use Effect is a hook -- useEffect()
import it from react

This hook is used to execute side effects means running something in 
a background. No need to call manually but it will triggered based on some
changes inside component.

If you include useEffect hook without any dependency It will trigger first time when the component mounted in browser. Also, it will trigger everytime if  any state change inside that component

If you are getting triggered output 2 times that is due to <sctrictMode> which is included inside main.jsx . you can comment it to stop that testing part.

By default useEffect triggered everytime when any state change inside your component.

I want to triggered useEffect only one time then?
pass [] dependency then it will run only once.
