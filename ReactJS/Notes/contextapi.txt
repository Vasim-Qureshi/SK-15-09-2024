Wheen we are using React application we can create local state
which is used inside a single component, we can create using
useState hook.

But this variable we can use only inside a single component where
we have create it.

Now If you want to use it to its child component, we can take the help
of props and we can pass data from parent to Child.

What if you have multiple Parent Child herachical Structure.
GrandParent --> Parent --> Child and child want to use Grand Parents data
Pass data using props which is called Prop Drilling

Some times code becomes very much complex if you are passing data between
many components.

What is Solution?
    Context API 
    Redux (Global State Management library)

*********** Context API ****************
-----------------------------------------

Managing the data between multipl components
To create it

use createContext() function which is available in React

once context is create create Provider for that context which can provide 
multiple data, functions etc.....

Once Provider is Ready register in one component like app or main.jsx file

means where you want to use it outside of that you can put the Provider.
example: if you want to use provide inside GrandParent and its all children 
then include it in app component and inside that provide Grand Parent Comp.

<Provider>
    <GrandParent />
</Provide>

You can use now this provider data in GrandParent, parent and Child component
without using props.

How to Access Context?
use hook named useContext()

---- const {data_which_you_want_to_use} =useContext(Pass-name-of-Your-context)
