Components
-----------------
Reusable piece of code using that we can structure our application.
We can set how our application looks like (UI) and how it behaves.

Using component we can break down our Bigger UI into small components.

Components Types:

1. Functional Components (modern component)
 very much preferred now a days in react implementation

These are JavaScript functions where you can create state and pass data as props and return JSX
we can also use different types hooks like useState,useEffect etc..

function MyComponent(){
	//here we can declare variables 
	//functions 
	return(
		<> Here We can write JSX</>
	)
}

if you are using same component at same file then no need to export but if you wnat to use it in diffrent file then you have 
to export
like export default MyComponent

When you are using it you can use it by importing the same.
