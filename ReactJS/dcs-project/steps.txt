=================================================================
To make above code realistic

create one seperate backend folder and cretae data.json file
open terminal: json-server data.json
you can see the api endpoint through that you cna do crud operation

in case json-server is not installed: npm i json-server -g (-g for global installation)

Once your API is Reacy your can change code for register and login as shown
After Login to redirect user to dashboard page create dashboard.jsx components
also register it in app.jsx route code.
