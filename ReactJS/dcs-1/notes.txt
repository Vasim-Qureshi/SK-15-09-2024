node is runtime environment using that we can run any javascript program withot embedding them 
in HTMl, means we don'e required any browser to run javascript

Earlier JS is only used for CSS (Client Side Scripting) but now
we can use for SSS (Server Side Scripting)

IN node to use any third party thing we need to install packages. which we can use for our
project.

This installation canbe done in 2 ways
1. global installation
    let's say if you want to use some package like type Script (language similar to javascript)
    we can install them and we can run its command through terminal.

    > npm i -g typescript
    once it is installed you can verify the global packages
    > npm ls -g
    You can execute command of typescript in terminal
    >tsc -v
    (in case if you are not able to see the version aftre installation you can restart vscode
    and check again)

    again uninstall
    >npm uninstall -g typescript
    once it is uninstall then install it locally
    >npm i typescript (this will install typescript locally/ means it will create
    package.json, package-lock.json, node-modules folder)

    now execute the command> tsc -v (you will get an error)
    means if you want to execute few packages from terminal and you wwant to use it throught out
    your system you can install package globally,

    IF you want to use some certain packages with diffrent version in a seperate folders
    the install package locally.

    Its always suggested to go with local installation
    ================================================================
    We can also install few dependencies at develeopment level which is called dev dependencies.
    These dependencies we can use for develeopment but not for production.

    npm i nodemon --save-dev
    you can verify this by opening your package.json file.

    if you try to run directly from cmd it won't run it will error
    but if you want to run you can open package.json file and add Script
    let's i want to check version

    add version command in package.json
    "scripts": {
    "version": "nodemon -v"
  },

  then run: npm run version and you can see version in terminal
