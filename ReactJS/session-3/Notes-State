Whne you try to change normal variables value react
cannot render the same.

For that react provide concept of state.
to create state we can use hook named useState()

it can accept any value as an argument which consider
initial value

useState(0) //0 id the initial value
useState('Sonam Soni')
useState(null)
useState([])
useState({})

this hook return an array where ther 0th index
represent variable name and 1st index represents
function to change the state of that variable

const [name,setName]=useState('Sonam Soni');
const [count,setCount]=useState(0);
const [user,setUser]=useState(null)

whenever the state get updated browser renders the 
updated vallue
