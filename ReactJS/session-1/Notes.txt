React
------------------------
Its a JavaScript library which is helping us to create frontend projects.
We can create SPA (single page application)

Its having multiple features:

1. JSX: JavaScript XML

	allows you to write HTML code to JS page directly
	which makes your code more readable and easy to write.

2. Virtual DOM:

	Efficiently updates and renders components by comparing virtual DOM with Real DOM.

	Reducing unnecessary re rendering, which improves application performance.

3. Component Based Architecture:
	
	We can divide our application into multiple reusable components which can manage logic and UI 
	Easy to maintain and scale.

4. One-way binding:

	Data always flows in one direction from parent to child component.
	easy to make data management predictable.
