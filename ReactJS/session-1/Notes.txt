React
------------------------
Its a JavaScript library which is helping us to create frontend projects.
We can create SPA (single page application)

Its having multiple features:

1. JSX: JavaScript XML

	allows you to write HTML code to JS page directly
	which makes your code more readable and easy to write.

2. Virtual DOM:

	Efficiently updates and renders components by comparing virtual DOM with Real DOM.

	Reducing unnecessary re rendering, which improves application performance.

3. Component Based Architecture:
	
	We can divide our application into multiple reusable components which can manage logic and UI 
	Easy to maintain and scale.

4. One-way binding:

	Data always flows in one direction from parent to child component.
	easy to make data management predictable.

How to create React Application
--------------------------------------
first of all we need node JS to be installed in our system.

Let's Verify

open cmd
node -v (check Node version)
npm -v  (check NPM version)
npx -v (Check NPX version)

NPM is node package manager
it is used to manage the packages of Node
you can install the packages like: npm install mysql
you can uninstall the packages like: npm uninstall MySQL

NPX is node package executor
it will execute a particular package and gives you the required things without installing that package.

Simply earlier we are installing react and then creating react projects but now we have npx using that we can create
react project without installing react to our system.

How?

npx create-react-app firstapp (this command will create folder named firstapp)
move to that folder: cd firstapp
run application using: npm start
==================================================================================

We have another fastest way to create and run react application

for that we can take help of vite tool.

npm create vite@latest
give the project name: firstapp
select framework: React
select Language: javascript
press enter

Your project must be ready

Move to the folder: cd firstapp
install dependencies: npm install
open project in VS Code: code .
run the project: npm run dev

click on the link and see the output in the browser
By default vite app runs on the default port 5173

in browser: http://localhost:5173/

You can see the default output of your application.

Let's Understand the project Structure:

package.json is the config file which comes with project creation

when you execute npm install command it will create 
package-lock.json file (it contains the location from where the packages downloaded)
& node_modules folder (it contains all downloaded packages)

readMe and gitignore files are added for GitHub

by default it loads index.html file which is having one div with id root

also index.html includes one script which is main.jsx
this script is loading one component calles <App /> it code written in app.jsx

you can change the code as mentioned below.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the world of React</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App

(save and check the output)
