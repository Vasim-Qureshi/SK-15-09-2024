Step no 1: download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

once it is downloaded install by selected default options

click next -- next -- next and last finish.

Once git installed successfully check version in cmd

open cmd and execute below command: git --version

--------------------------------------------------------------

OPEN GitHub.com and create account by clicking on signUp.

remember your email id which is associated with GitHub and also your username and password.

now again let's configure global credentials

open cmd and execute below command.

git config --global user.email "enter your email id"
git config --global user.name "enter your username"

(below command to see the configured email and username)
git config --global --list

Now Let's create one folder named my project and create one file inside same.

Let's open that folder in cmd / terminal

after that initialize git repo

> git init (it will initialize git repo to that folder and create one .git hidden folder in the same.

to check the status use
>git status

to add files in staging area

> git add "file name"

to remove file from staging area

> git rm --cached "file name"

If you want to add it again then 

git add "filename"

once its is added let's add it into Local Repository for that use commit command

> git commit -m "version 1"

to check the committed details use
>git log
to see the logs in one line
>git log --oneline

Noe its make some changes to your existing file
then check the status again >git status

After that if you don't want that modified content then 
>git restore "file name"

Let's Modify the file again and now execute the command 
>git diff 

you can see the difference between committed files and modified files

Let's add this changes to staging area
> git add "My Data.txt"

After that if you want to see the differences you can use
>git diff --staged

Then you can commit which will become your second commit
for checking changes between commits you can use again diff command from head to other commit pointer

>git diff head (hash code of other commit)

For rollbacking the commit you can use reset command
>git reset pointer-of-commit-where-you-want-to-reset

(by default it will do soft reset me it reverts the commit and staging area but still changes will be there in working directory

for removing those changes also you can use --hard (hard reset)

========================================================================================
For push code from local to remote

create new repository add its name, description and create

then execute below commands

> git branch -M main
> git remote add origin (your repository link)
> git push -u origin main

(when you push very first time then it will pop up with authentication select browser authentication add your credentials of GitHub if its authenticated successfully then the data get pushed)

refresh the repository and check your pushed content.

If you want to push new data to that same location just execute add, commit and push command again.
