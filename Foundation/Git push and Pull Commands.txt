Now locally if you try to update file.txt
>echo "new line added" >> file.txt (update the existing file)
>git add .
>git commit -m "file updated"
>git push -u origin main (this line will give error as remote branch is 1 step ahead from local)

>git pull (it will pull readme.md file to your local repo)
>git push -u origin main (it will push code to remote Repo)
